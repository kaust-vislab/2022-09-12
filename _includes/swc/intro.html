  The KAUST Visualization Core Lab (KVL) will host an <em>Introduction to the Shell for (Data) Scientists</em> 
  workshop. KVL staff will provide an introduction to shell commands designed for 
  learners with little or no previous experience working with shell commands.
</p>

  The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so 
  long because it’s a power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few 
  keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate 
  repetitive tasks so they aren’t typing the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is 
  fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources with clusters 
  either locally at KAUST (i.e., Ibex, Nesser, Shaheen, etc) or in the cloud (GCP, AWS, Azure, etc).
</p>
<p>
  Topics covered will include
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Navigating files and directories</li>
  <li>Working with files and directories</li>
  <li>Pipes and filters</li>
  <li>Loops</li>
  <li>Shell scripting</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This hands-on lesson is part of the <em>Introduction to Data Science Workshop Series</em> 
  being offered by KVL as part of our on-going efforts to build 
  capacity in core data science skills both at KAUST and within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).

  The workshop curriculum largely follows the 
  <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">curriculum</a> developed by 
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>, a volunteer project dedicated to helping 
  researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research 
  computing skills.
</p>
<p>
  This is a live-coding based workshop and learners are expected to work along with the instructor using freely 
  available cloud resources provided by the <a href="https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Binder</a> project.
